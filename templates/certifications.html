        <p>
I have successfully completed a comprehensive <b>Data Science course</b>, where I gained extensive knowledge and practical experience in the field. The course covered the entire data science lifecycle, including <b>data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization</b>, and model building.
        </p>
        <p>
During the course, I worked on multiple real-world projects, utilizing various datasets to solve practical problems. These projects helped me develop a strong understanding of <b>statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, data visualization techniques</b>, and Python programming.

        <p>
I successfully completed a 45-day project training program titled <b> "Service Call Management – System"</b> at E-Gain, where I developed a real-world application using <b>Python and MySQL</b>. The goal of my project was to create a system that could efficiently manage service calls—such as customer support requests—by tracking their status, storing relevant details, and ensuring smooth data handling through a connected database.

        </p>
        <p>
During the training, I designed and built the backend logic using Python, which included functions for adding new service requests, updating their progress, and retrieving records based on different filters. <b> I used MySQL to create and manage the database, </b>writing queries to store, update, and fetch service-related data. I also focused on making the system user-friendly and reliable, ensuring that it could handle multiple service entries without errors.

        </p>
        <p>
This project helped me strengthen my skills in Python programming, database management, and problem-solving. I learned how to connect Python with MySQL, handle real-time data, and apply my technical knowledge to solve practical business problems. Overall, <b>it was a great experience that boosted my confidence and gave me hands-on exposure to building a complete working system.</b>

        <p>
 I recently completed a virtual job simulation called GenAI Powered Data Analytics, which was offered by Forage in collaboration with Tata Group. It’s basically like a hands-on internship where I got to work on real-world business tasks that a data analyst would typically handle.

        </p>
The best part is that this simulation was designed by Tata, which is a globally respected company, so it really adds credibility to my profile. The certificate is signed by the CEO of Forage, and it shows that I’m capable of applying data science skills in practical, business-driven scenarios."

        <p>
In May 2024, I successfully completed a one-month internship in Advance Data Science and Artificial Intelligence offered by Ybi Foundation, a reputed organization recognized by <b> the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India.</b> During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in advanced concepts of data science, including machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and real-world AI applications.


        </p>
        <p>
I worked on practical datasets, applied Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, and developed predictive models to extract actionable insights. The program also emphasized ethical AI practices and <b>industry-relevant problem-solving</b>, enhancing both my technical proficiency and analytical thinking. This internship has significantly strengthened my foundation in AI and data science, preparing me for future roles in business analytics and intelligent system development.

        <p>
Recently, I completed an Advanced Power BI certification course through the <b>SimpliLearn website</b>. This program provided me with in-depth knowledge of data visualization, business intelligence, and dashboard creation using Power BI. Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience with advanced features such as <b>DAX functions</b>, Power Query, and data modeling techniques. I also learned how to build interactive reports and dashboards that deliver actionable insights for business decision-making. The certification has strengthened my ability to analyze complex datasets and present findings in a visually compelling and strategic manner, which I believe will be highly valuable in real-world data analytics projects.
