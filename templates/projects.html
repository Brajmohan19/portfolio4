        <p>
I am currently working on a website called Voables.com, designed specifically for a business consultancy. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind, with JavaScript adding interactive features to enhance user experience. For the backend, I am using Django to manage data, handle server-side logic, and integrate dynamic content. Currently, the frontend design is complete, and I am actively working on the backend development to ensure all features function smoothly. This project aims to provide a professional and responsive platform for clients seeking business consultancy services, and it is still a work in progress as I continue to improve both design and functionality.

        <p>
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of mobile sales data using Python in Jupyter Notebook to uncover trends, patterns, and business insights. The dataset included details such as brand names, model types, price ranges, sales volumes, customer ratings, and regional performance. I started by cleaning and preprocessing the data using Pandas and NumPy to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and convert data types for analysis. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps, which revealed key insights — such as which brands dominated sales, how pricing affected customer ratings, and which regions showed the highest demand. 

        </p>
        <p>
I also segmented the data to compare budget vs premium phones and analyzed seasonal trends in sales. Based on the findings, I provided actionable recommendations like optimizing inventory for high-demand regions, focusing marketing efforts on top-performing models, and adjusting pricing strategies to boost customer satisfaction. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling, while also demonstrating how data science can drive smarter business decisions in the retail and electronics sector.

Customer feedback is captured through rating status, where most users rated their experience as Excellent or Good. The payment method breakdown indicates that Credit Card is the most preferred option, followed by Debit Card and Cash. Model-wise sales analysis shows iPhone XS and iPhone 11 as top performers, while weekday-wise sales data reveals that Saturdays generate the highest revenue. Overall, this dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by offering insights into regional performance, customer behavior, and product trends — making it a powerful tool for business strategy and planning.

        <p>
This mobile sales dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across India. It highlights key metrics such as total revenue of ₹769 million, 19,000 units sold, 4,000 transactions, and an average selling price of ₹40.11K. The interactive filters at the top

A map visualization shows city-wise sales distribution, with Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore emerging as top contributors. Monthly quantity trends reveal seasonal fluctuations, with March recording the highest sales volume.</p>

charts showing churn distribution across different customer segments. The final output provided clear recommendations for the business — such as offering loyalty benefits to long-term customers, promoting annual contracts, and improving service quality for high-risk segments. This project not only strengthened my skills in Python, data visualization, and machine learning, but also taught me how to extract actionable business insights from real-world data.

        <p>
In this Amazon Prime EDA project, the initial step involved handling missing data to ensure analytical accuracy. The 'IMDb Rating' column, which contained null values, was imputed using the mode — the most frequently occurring rating — to preserve the central tendency of viewer scores. Simultaneously, the 'Plot' column’s missing entries were replaced with the placeholder text 'No Data', maintaining consistency in textual fields and avoiding null-related errors during analysis. After these cleaning steps, the number of missing values in each column was printed to confirm that the dataset was now complete and ready for further exploration. Next, the data was grouped by 'Movie Name' to calculate the mean IMDb rating, allowing us to identify the top 10 highest-
        </p>
        <p>
rated titles based on aggregated viewer feedback. To focus the analysis on a specific era, the dataset was filtered to include only movies released between 1961 and 2000 — a period rich in cinematic evolution. Finally, a bar chart was plotted to visualize IMDb ratings, where movies released before 2000 were represented with dark blue bars, while those released beyond 2000 were shown in a contrasting color. This color-coded visualization helped highlight temporal trends in movie ratings and made it easier to compare content performance across different decades.
